This is the Read Me file for the submission of the Interim Review (Report and Proof-of-Concept Programs).

The file structure is as follows:
	> The Interim Report is the PDF file titled: "Zeac010-Interim.pdf". This should be opened with any PDF viewer, where the file structure is outlined within the Table of Contents page.

	> Each of the different Proof-of-Concept programs have their own folder within this directory. For example, the proof-of-concept correlating with drawing shapes using HTML5 canvas is within the folder titled: "Drawing Shapes", which is the same for each of the different proof-of-concept programs. 

	> To run/execute each of the programs, the index.html file should be opened using the default browser/browser of choice. This will then load up the different web applications that have been created. Files should not be moved from their respective directory/folder, as the links to specific aspects of the code will no longer function as intended. 

Thank you!
